 ### Create ServiceTrackers
 Before the application will provision, the Crossplane control cluster must
 be configured to connect to a provider (e.g. GCP, Azure, AWS, Alibaba).

 ```shell
 cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
 apiVersion: oam.apps.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
 kind: ServiceTracker
 metadata:
   name: servicetracker-sample
 EOF
 ```
 The stack (and Crossplane) will take care of the rest.
